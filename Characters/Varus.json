If removal occurs before an interval after one having been passed, remaining stacks are not applied.\nIf the  root is not applied, such as by the target negating its application with  crowd control immunity or a  spell shield, the target will not be inflicted with  Blight stacks and the tendril will not root into the ground at their location (thus preventing it from seeking). This applies to both the primary target and secondary targets that were caught by the tendril.\nThe tendril seeks and registers valid targets every 0.264 seconds.\nEnemy champions can be targeted again by the corruption's tether if they were not infected the previous time, even if they were targeted and exited its range.\nThe tendril cannot seek enemy champions that are  untargetable, and will also stop seeking a target if it becomes untargetable (fails to apply its effects even if they remain in the area).\nVarus will turn to face the target direction at the start of the cast.\nThis ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.\nChain of Corruption can generate  Blight stacks for Varus to detonate with any ability, even if Blighted Quiver has not been learned. The base detonation damage per Blight stack scales with Blighted Quiver's rank, which has a value at rank 0 of 2.5% of the target's maximum health per stack detonated.",
