      "description_source": "The attacks do not affect structures.\nThe first stack of Break the Mold that is applied to a target will snapshot the targets current  armor and  magic resistance. All subsequent stacks will reduce the targets resistances based on the snapshotted amount, even if the target's total resistances change. This snapshot lasts until the debuff expires.\nFor example, applying a stack of Break the Mold to a champion with 100  armor and  magic resistance will reduce their resistance by 3 and grant Rell the lost stats. If their resistances are then boosted to 500 before another stack is applied, the subsequent stack will only reduce their resistance by a further 3 despite 3% of 500 being 15.\nAnother example, when a target has temporarily gained increased resistances before Rell applies the first stack of Break the Mold then the snapshot of the target's stats will be of the increased amount. This can result in targets losing significantly more resistances after the duration of the increase ends, for as long as the stacks don't fall off.\nIf a target has 100 base resistances, and they are increased to 500 temporarily before Break the Mold is applied, then the target will lose a total of 15 resistances, up to a total of 75 resistances at 5 stacks, and when the target's resistance buff ends they would only have 25 remaining.",
