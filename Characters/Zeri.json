This does include jungle plants, structures, and wards.\nWards will only be hit once by Burst Fire. Stealthed wards and traps will not be hit.\nChampion-summoned units behave differently depending on the unit.\n Gangplank's  Powder Keg and  Yorick's  Dark Procession are hit only once by Burst Fire, and any subsequent rounds not empowered by  Spark Surge will stop upon reaching the same object.\n Kalista's  Sentinel is hit only once by Burst Fire, but any subsequent rounds will continue to travel through the Sentinel.\nIf Burst Fire hits an enemy while Zeri is not visible to enemies, the area around her (400 units) will be revealed for 4.5 seconds.\nBurst Fire rolls  critical strike for all rounds as well as the additional physical damage dealt when Zeri is  Overcharged.\nBurst Fire is parried by  dodge and  block.\n Blind causes Burst Fire to cast in a random direction. The rounds will still deal damage to enemies hit.\nBurst Fire's rounds are each fired in the target direction from where Zeri is at the time.\nOnly attack speed granted by being  Overcharged can exceed the cap of 1.5.\n Hail of Blades does not allow Zeri to exceed her attack speed cap.\nItem and rune effects that trigger off of attacking (e.g.,  Fleet Footwork and  Kraken Slayer) will only trigger if Burst Fire hits a unit.\nIf Zeri would reach maximum  Energized stacks from a Burst Fire cast, the remaining rounds will trigger Energized's effect.\nBurst Fire's cast-indicator does not show  range increases; modified range VFX are still visible around the champion model.\nBurst Fire can apply the effect of  Horizon Focus when the enemy hit is within the last 50 units of this ability.(note)\nBurst Fire uses a modified icon when empowered by  Spark Surge () and  Lightning Crash () as well as both ().\nDestroying a ward that is targetable but not visible to Zeri's team (e.g. a  Control Ward in Fog of War) via Burst Fire uniquely allows her to remove its accompanying ward timer (if it exists) without seeing the ward being destroyed.\nIf Zeri is affected by an ally  Bard's  Tempered Fate during Burst Fire's cast time, she will be able to cast it during the effect.(bug)",
