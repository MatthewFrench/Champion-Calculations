      "description": "Innate: Upon dying,  Sion  reanimates into a frenzy where he is restored to max health that rapidly decays, and reduces incoming  healing.",
      "description_source": "Details\n\nSion's death timer starts when he dies and not when Glory in Death ends.\nIf Sion lives longer than what his death timer lasts for, he will not revive until Glory in Death has ended. When it ends, he instantly revives. This may result in some odd interactions and bugs at times.\nThe effect that heals Sion back to full health at the start of Glory in Death cannot be modified by  healing reductions and does not count towards the 'Damage Healed' statistic at the end of game lobby.\nGlory in Death has a capped 60 seconds duration. If the player manages to survive for so long, Sion dies instantly, regardless of his current health.\nThe healing modifier during Glory in Death reduces all incoming healing, it does not matter if they are sourced from Sion himself or an ally. This does not affect life steal.\nThis healing modifier stacks additively with  Spirit Visage and does not stack with heal and shield power.\nThis means that purchasing Spirit Visage enables Sion to have regeneration and use healing effects at 25% effectiveness, and the life steal gained will be increased to 125% as expected.\nThe fixed attack speed is achieved by lowering and increasing the maximum and minimum attack speed to  1.75, respectively.\nThis also means that it's unaffected by other attack speed modifiers for the duration, such as bonus attack speed or  cripples.\nHowever,  Hail of Blades, which allows for the normal attack speed cap (attack speed) to be surpassed, will also break this limit. This means that while it is active, Sion may exceed his  1.75 cap, but cannot fall below it.\nWhen  Hail of Blades ends, the attack speed cap will revert to  3.0 and not to  1.75, however Sion still can't fall below  1.75.\nSome item passives do not persist through death and will be lost for the initial few seconds of Glory in Death.\n Phase Rush's cooldown is reset upon entering Glory in Death.\nThe bonus on-hit damage granted by Glory in Death is unaffected by life steal.\nHowever, it can be applied against structures that are not turrets.(bug)\nThe reduction of damage against structures includes Sion's attacks as well as on-hit effects that can be applied to structures, such as  Demolish,  Titanic Hydra and the magic damage based on AP conversion based on  adaptive force.\nIt even includes  true damage from sources such as  Elixir of Sorcery.(note)\nSion, during Glory in Death, will not lose health while being carried by  Fate's Call.\nGlory in Death does not trigger on clones of Sion, such as with  Test of Spirit.\nGlory in Death's  untargetability from the  stasis does not  destroy in-flight  projectiles.\nProjectiles created while Sion is in the zombie form will still travel to him even after he dies.\nUpon death, the current cooldowns of Sion's summoner spells are increased to 4 seconds. Afterwards, he is still unable to use them until he respawns.\nHowever, it is possible for another lock-out effect to unlock them when their duration ends (excluding  crowd control with the exception of  stasis).\nAfter Glory in Death ends, the corpse of Sion will retain unit collision despite being dead on the ground.\nBuffs from jungle monsters that Sion acquired during Glory in Death will not be lost when the duration ends. ( Crest of Cinders,  Crest of Insight)\nInteractions & Other\n\nBy surviving for the full duration of 60 seconds, Sion will have suffered 41.8k : 490.9k (based on level) in health costs.\nSion can also heal from  spell vamp, althought the stat is currently unobtainable and it would be also unusable during Glory in Death, since there would be no available abilities that would apply it.\nEven though its visuals are present,  Dark Harvest can never be gained from Sion under the effect of Glory in Death.\nAt the start of Glory in Death, Sion's  mana drops to 0, but his  mana regeneration will remain in effect.\nZombie info\nZombie states trigger upon taking  lethal damage.\n Raw damage effects will not prevent zombie states from triggering.\nAll  resurrection effects will take precedence over effects that reanimate as a zombie.\nA champion that enters a zombie state will start their death timer upon triggering the effect.\nMost buffs and debuffs will be lost upon transitioning into a zombie state.\nThose that persist through death, such as  Brand's  Blaze, will remain.\nUndisplayed marker buffs, such as those imposed by  Veigar's  Event Horizon and  Viktor's  Gravity Field to prevent being affected multiple times by the same effect, will be lost.(bug)\nThis does not apply when transitioning from one zombie state to another zombie state.(bug)\nUnits within a zombie state cannot:\nUse  Recall or  Refillable Potion.\nActivate  resurrection effects.\nTake  Dark Passage, Catapult, or  gates.\nInitate the  Rift Herald Rodeo.\nPick up the  Eye of the Herald.\nBe targeted by the following:\n Bailout\n Chronoshift\n Umbral Trespass.\nBe affected by the following:\n Curse of the Black Mist\n Fear Beyond Death's chain missile\n Test of Spirit's initial missile\n Lamb's Respite\n Realm of Death\nFountain health restore",
