For example,  Annie's  Tibbers will continue to inflict burn damage on surrounding units while being held.\nGrabbing a  Dark Sphere will cause the duration on it to refresh, but only on the first cast, not when it is thrown.\nForce of Will has additional effects when targeting the  Blue Sentinel and  Red Brambleback. Throwing the former will refund 10  mana to Syndra upon cast and will reduce the  cooldown of Force of Will by 1 second, while throwing the latter will apply the  Crest of Cinders burn to any affected units in the area of effect.\nForce of Will's first cast uses a  modified icon while it has the  Transcendent bonus.",
