Vision from  minions,  wards, and  turrets will not prevent Fiddlesticks from  fearing if there are no nearby enemy champions.\nThere is a very brief grace period after being seen or when entering combat.

There is no indicator to say that Fiddlesticks is out of combat; and no indicator or debuff icon on affected enemies.\nA visual indicator will circle around all enemy champions while Fiddlesticks is channeling  Crowstorm if it is unseen.
