      "description": "Mordekaiser's Realm of Death. Champions outside of the death realm are seen as spirits. Blue spirits (above Mordekaiser) are allied champions while red spirits (below Mordekaiser) are enemy champions.\nAlly spirit\nEnemy spirit\nThe Death Realm is a battlefield that exists outside of the normal realm in an alternate \"dimension\". It exists only for Mordekaiser and his target. It consists of an arena that has a radius of 1200 units and includes any terrain features that would exist in the map of the normal realm, including walls and  brushes.\nThe boundaries of the arena are impassable but not considered terrain themselves ( Unstoppable Onslaught exception), and enemies that try to move out of the area will be displaced back inside.\n Dashes,  blinks,  displacements and other forms of movement will cap their effect range to the boundary. Targets will stop at the boundary even after it expired.\nDuring the cast time of Realm of Death, it is possible to pathfind outside the boundaries of the arena by issuing a movement command toward an area that becomes inaccessible due to terrain inside the Death Realm.(bug)[42]\nRealm of Death retains Mordekaiser's previous current health percentage when granting him a portion of the target's maximum health.\nRealm of Death's  healing is affected by healing modifiers.\nRealm of Death does not trigger in-combat effects.\nRealm of Death will cancel and go on cooldown after its cast time if:\nThe target is  displacement immune,  crowd control immune or protected by a  spell shield.\nNote that all of the above are ineffective if they are applied after the target has been banished.\nThe target is a  clone or  Sion when his  Glory in Death is active.\nIf the target becomes  untargetable,  dies, is too far away or Mordekaiser loses  sight of them due to  nearsight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on  cooldown.\nIf either Mordekaiser or the target  dies at the same time of the transition into the Death Realm, the Death Realm will not end prematurely and will continue until its full duration has ended.(bug)[43]\nIf the target dies this way, Mordekaiser will not keep their stats after leaving the Death Realm.(bug)\n Tahm Kench's  Devour will always trigger this bug if used during the cast of Realm of Death and the spit would kill Mordekaiser.(bug)[44]\nIf Mordekaiser or the target cast another Realm of Death, the affected champions will remain stuck for the duration of the new circle.\nThe previous circle will be overridden by the new one; it will be dispelled to enter the new circle.\n Spell shield will not block the initial  slow.\nThe  reveal effect lasts for 1.25 seconds from the start of the cast time if the cast does not complete. Otherwise, the reveal ends as soon as the cast time completes.\nUpon entering or leaving the Death Realm, targets revealed by effects such as  Ignite or  Ashe's  Hawkshot will keep the  reveal VFX but will stop being revealed.(bug)[45]\nIf the target's  health is lower than the amount that should be stolen, they will be brought down to 1 health. Mordekaiser will still get the intended amount of maximum health.\nIf the target's  health is higher than their  health after the reduction, they will lose the excess HP on top of taking 10% of their maximum health as damage. This happens because Realm of Death first reduces 10% of the target's maximum health, and then deals an additional 10% of their maximum health as damage.\nRealm of Death's maximum health reduction ignores  invulnerability effects.\nEntering or leaving the Death Realm will cause all targeted  projectiles to be  destroyed.\nThe transition in and out of the Death Realm doesn't interrupt  channels.\n Grand Starfall will always be interrupted by the transition into the realm.\nRealm of Death will not be dispelled if either of the two affected champions enter  resurrection after taking lethal damage. It is dispelled if the target enters a  zombie state.\nAny active  tether effects (both friendly and hostile ones) existing on either of the two champions entering the realm will be broken (unless the tether is between those two).\nUpon entering the realm, Mordekaiser and the target are  cleansed from all  forced action effects.\nThe cleanse will occur even if the source of the crowd control enters the realm.(bug)\nUnlike the other stats, Mordekaiser does not steal enemy total size; instead he gains 10% of his own size and reduces the enemy's size by 10% of theirs (all size modifiers stack additively).\nMordekaiser grows in size over 0.25 seconds after successfully stealing his targets' stats, and shrinks over 0.25 seconds after the buff runs out again. The target shrinks over 0.25 seconds after their stats are stolen, but grows back to normal size instantly when the effect ends.\nWhile Mordekaiser has hold of his enemy's stats, that champion's circular portrait will appear as a pip next to his health bar, visible to all players.\nThe champion's portrait will ocasionally stay even after Mordekaiser has lost hold of the enemy's stats.(bug)\nRealm of Death's interactions with other elements/abilities (This list might be incomplete, last updated on patch V26.03):\nMultiple Death Realms (possible through a  hijacked Realm of Death or if multiple Mordekaisers are in the same match) spawned will exist in the same realm, allowing champions to see and interact with champions bound to other circles. Champions are only affected by their boundaries and are not able to see the others.\nIf another Realm of Death is cast while one is already active, upon leaving, the spirits from the second Realm of Death will be invisible from the perspective of the players affected by the first Realm of Death.(bug)[46]\n Tahm Kench's  Devour can carry a target outside of their circle, but they will be displaced back inside once  Regurgitated.\nAn active  Cease and Desist on a target outside the perimeter will cause  Vi to continue her charge until her circle ends. She can knock back and damage secondary targets multiple times.\nChampions inside the Death Realm continue gaining  gold and  experience from any source, which includes nearby and global bounties as well as neutral buffs.\nStructures exist in all realms at the same time.  Turrets will behave normally as if all units were in the same realm.\n Turret's Crystalline Overgrowth can still be triggered while inside the Death Realm.\nThe Overgrowth's VFX of the Outer Turrets (Tier 1) will be invisible inside the Death Realm.(bug)[47]\nThe faelights and jungle plants ( Blast Cone,  Honeyfruit,  Scryer's Bloom) will not be present in the Death Realm.\nThe faelights indicator will still be visible if the player's cursor is placed in their location.(bug)[48]\nThe  Blast Cone's landing indicator will still be visible while in the Death Realm and within its range.(bug)[49]\nEpic  monsters, with the exception of  Voidgrub's, will be visible for a brief moment after entering the Death Realm, but they will be untargetable.(bug)[50]\n Hex-gates on  Hextech Rift will not be present between realms.\n Eye of the Herald and  Teleport are disabled while in the Death Realm.\nUsing  Unsealed Spellbook to swap Teleport for another summoner spell while in the Death Realm will disable the new summoner spell until the user leaves the realm.(bug)[51]\nControllable pets and  clones can still be commanded between realms.\nMordekaiser will be given gold, if applicable, for  pets killed at the end of Realm of Death.\n Illaoi's  Tentacles will not be killed at the end of Realm of Death.(note)\n Annie's  Tibbers,  Heimerdinger's  H-28Q Apex Turret,  Ivern's  Daisy and  Yorick's  Maiden are considered as \"large pets\" for the purposes of this ability and will follow their respective  champions between realms.\nIf Mordekaiser dies inside of Death Realm while his  Darkness Rise is hitting any of these pets, Darkness Rise will keep affecting the pets until they die or Darkness Rise deactivates normally.(bug)[52]\nSwitching realms detaches all  attached champions on either of the two champions entering the realm.\nThe allied health, resource, and ultimate indicators (champion portraits located on the screen) will not update between realms as the players have no  vision of them.\nPings used in the Death Realm will appear in the chat and mini-map, but will not appear in the map.(note)\nAny spawned terrain while in the Death Realm will remain inside until expired. They will not be destroyed.\nExcept for some cases, spells that require a target to be cast (e.g  Akali's  Shuriken Flip,  Twitch's  Contaminate) will not affect enemies in other realms nor will be castable if there's no targets in the same realm as the caster.\n Amumu's  Bandage Toss,  Blitzcrank's  Rocket Grab,  Leona's  Zenith Blade,  Nautilus'  Dredge Line,  Pyke's  Bone Skewer and  Thresh's  Death Sentence will still hit targets if their caster switches realms before they hit.\n Camille's  The Hextech Ultimatum,  Dr. Mundo's  Goes Where He Pleases,  Nunu & Willump's  Biggest Snowball Ever! and  Absolute Zero,  Pyke's  Death from Below,  Ryze's  Realm Warp,  Shen's  Spirit's Refuge,  Taliyah's  Worked Ground and  Zed's  Shadows will follow their caster between realms.\n Braum's  Glacial Fissure[53],  Pantheon's  Grand Starfall*[54],  Singed's  Mega Adhesive[55],  Varus'  Hail of Arrows[56],  Yasuo's  Wind Wall[57],  Ziggs'  Satchel Charge*[58] and  Zilean's  Time Bomb*[59] will follow their caster between realms but will only be visible in the realm they were cast.(bug)\n Ahri's  Orb of Deception will stay in the realm it was cast.\nThe orb will still go back towards  Ahri's position.\n Akshan's  Avengerang will stay in the realm it was cast.\nThe boomerang will only go back towards  Akshan's position if it was already doing so during the realm switch.\n Akshan's  Comeuppance bullets will get destroyed if he switches realms, even if its target is Mordekaiser.\n Anivia's  Glacial Storm will not be dispelled if Anivia switches realms, but it will only be present in the realm it was cast.\n Bel'Veth's  Void Corals will only be present in the realm they spawned in.\nIf  Bel'Veth switches realms while she is consuming a Void Coral, the Void Coral will dissappear and she will not get her True Form nor deal damage to nearby enemies.\n Camille will still be able to use  Hookshot's dash if she switches realms before the spell hits.\n Ekko's  Parallel Convergence will only be visible in the realm it was cast, but he will still be able to trigger the spell's effect from another realm and it will only affect enemies in said realm.(bug)[60]\n Fizz's  Chum the Waters will follow its target between realms.\n Galio's  Winds of War will follow him if the spell was already on the ground before the realm switch, but it will only be visible in the realm it was cast.(bug)[61]\n Gnar's  Boulder Toss boulder will only be visible in the realm it was cast, but he can still pick it up if he goes to its location.(bug)[62]\n Illaoi's  Test of Spirit tether will be destroyed if her target switches realms.\n Test of Spirit's target will not be made into a Vessel.\n Irelia's  Flawless Duet will be recast automatically when switching realms, and will only affect enemies in the realm it was cast.\nIn some rare cases the spell's effect might follow  Irelia between realms, but it will only be visible in the realm it was cast.(bug)[63]\n Ivern's  Rootcaller can still be recast if the target is in a different realm than him.\n Ivern's  Brushmaker brushes might be visible for a few seconds after switching realms.(bug)[23]\nPassing by the position of a brush created by  Brushmaker in another realm will make units transparent for a few seconds, but they will still be visible to the enemy team.(bug)[23]\n Kai'Sa's  Killer Instinct can only be cast towards enemies in the same realm she is at.\n Kalista's  Fate's Call cannot be cast if her  oathsworn is in another realm, but if the spell was cast before entering the Death Realm, it will function as normal and will only affect targets in the oathsworn's realm.\n Karthus'  Requiem will damage enemies in all realms.\n Kayn's  Umbral Trespass will be interrupted and will not deal damage if its target switches realms.\n Kog'Maw's  Void Ooze will follow him between realms.(bug)[24]\nA part of the VFX will be left in the realm it was cast.(bug)[24]\n Lillia's  Lilting Lullaby will only affect enemies in the same realm as her.\n Lissandra's  Glacial Path can still be recast if the spell was initially cast in another realm.\n Lulu's  Pix will follow her between realms.\nHowever, if Pix is on another  champion, it will visually stay in Lulu's realm but will keep affecting enemies in the Death Realm.(bug)[64]\nPix will still be able to return to Lulu as normal, even if her ally's still in the Death Realm.\n Lux's  Final Spark will follow her between realms.\nThe beam's VFX will only be visible in the realm it was cast.(bug)[65]\n Malzahar's  Void Shift is special cased to not resist the slow but instead resist the realm switch after the cast completes.\n Malzahar's  Call of the Void will follow him if used moments before the realm switch. Also, a part of the VFX will be left in the realm it was cast.(bug)[66]\n Mel's  Golden Eclipse will only deal damage to enemies in the same realm she is at the end of the cast.\n Miss Fortune's  Make It Rain will follow her between realms.(bug)[28]\nThe spell's area VFX will not follow.(bug)[28]\n Naafiri's  Hounds' Pursuit dash will still go through if she switches realms during the cast.\n Nasus'  Spirit Fire will stay in the realm it was cast.\nHowever, the spell will keep affecting enemies in another realm if they were already affected by it before switching realms and they have not left the spell's area.(bug)[67]\n Nautilus'  Depth Charge will not follow its target between realms.(note)\n Neeko cannot be targeted by Realm of Death if she is disguised as a non- champion unit.\n Nilah's  Apotheosis will only deal damage to enemies in the realm it was cast.(note)\nIt will still heal/shield targets in  Nilah's realm at the end of the cast.\n Nocturne's  Paranoia only applies  nearsight to enemy champions in the same realm as him.\n Orianna's  Ball will go back to her after switching realms.\n Orianna's  Command: Shockwave will follow her between realms if her  ball is not on the ground.\nHowever, if her  ball is on the ground,  Command: Shockwave will still follow her between realms but its shockwave will be invisible.(bug)[68]\nAdditionally, if  Command: Shockwave is buffered while  her ball is still flying and she switches realms,  Command: Shockwave's will appear on top of  Orianna, but the actual shockwave will occur at the location  her ball was supposed to land.(bug)[69]\n Poppy's  Keeper's Verdict can send Mordekaiser outside of the Death Realm arena if she uses it during Realm of Death's cast.(bug)[70]\n Pyke's  Phantom Undertow will not follow him if he switches realms while the Phantom is coming back.\n Rakan's  Grand Entrance will follow him between realms, but its initial VFX will not.(bug)[71]\n Rek'Sai's  Tunnels will not follow her between realms.\nIf  Rek'Sai is already on a tunnel when switching realms, her  dash will not be interrupted.\n Sion's  Decimating Smash VFX will follow him between realms, but the spell will only affect enemies in the realm it was cast.(bug)[72]\n Soraka's  Wish will heal targets in all realms.\n Swain's  Nevermove can still be recast if the target is in another realm, but nothing will happen.(note)\n Sylas'  Abduct will not hit enemies if he switches realms during the spell's animation.\n Syndra's  Force of Will will cancel on realm switch.\n Syndra's  Unleashed Power will only affect enemies in the realm it was cast, even if its target is Mordekaiser.\n Tahm Kench's  Devour target will get spit on realm switch.\nThe spell will still deal damage.\n Taliyah's  Weaver's Wall will get interrupted on realm switch.\n Taric's  Bastion link will be temporarily disabled while in the Death Realm.

It is dispelled if the target enters a  zombie state.\nAny active  tether effects (both friendly and hostile ones) existing on either of the two champions entering the realm will be broken (unless the tether is between those two).\nUpon entering the realm, Mordekaiser and the target are  cleansed from all  forced action effects.\nThe cleanse will occur even if the source of the crowd control enters the realm.(bug)\nUnlike the other stats, Mordekaiser does not steal enemy total size; instead he gains 10% of his own size and reduces the enemy's size by 10% of theirs (all size modifiers stack additively).\nMordekaiser grows in size over 0.25 seconds after successfully stealing his targets' stats, and shrinks over 0.25 seconds after the buff runs out again. The target shrinks over 0.25 seconds after their stats are stolen, but grows back to normal size instantly when the effect ends.\nWhile Mordekaiser has hold of his enemy's stats, that champion's circular portrait will appear as a pip next to his health bar, visible to all players.\nThe champion's portrait will ocasionally stay even after Mordekaiser has lost hold of the enemy's stats.(bug)\nRealm of Death's interactions with other elements/abilities (This list might be incomplete, last updated on patch V26.03):\nMultiple Death Realms (possible through a  hijacked Realm of Death or if multiple Mordekaisers are in the same match) spawned will exist in the same realm, allowing champions to see and interact with champions bound to other circles. Champions are only affected by their boundaries and are not able to see the others.\nIf another Realm of Death is cast while one is already active, upon leaving, the spirits from the second Realm of Death will be invisible from the perspective of the players affected by the first Realm of Death.(bug)[46]\n Tahm Kench's  Devour can carry a target outside of their circle, but they will be displaced back inside once  Regurgitated.\nAn active  Cease and Desist on a target outside the perimeter will cause  Vi to continue her charge until her circle ends. She can knock back and damage secondary targets multiple times.\nChampions inside the Death Realm continue gaining  gold and  experience from any source, which includes nearby and global bounties as well as neutral buffs.\nStructures exist in all realms at the same time.  Turrets will behave normally as if all units were in the same realm.\n Turret's Crystalline Overgrowth can still be triggered while inside the Death Realm.\nThe Overgrowth's VFX of the Outer Turrets (Tier 1) will be invisible inside the Death Realm.(bug)[47]\nThe faelights and jungle plants ( Blast Cone,  Honeyfruit,  Scryer's Bloom) will not be present in the Death Realm.\nThe faelights indicator will still be visible if the player's cursor is placed in their location.(bug)[48]\nThe  Blast Cone's landing indicator will still be visible while in the Death Realm and within its range.(bug)[49]\nEpic  monsters, with the exception of  Voidgrub's, will be visible for a brief moment after entering the Death Realm, but they will be untargetable.(bug)[50]\n Hex-gates on  Hextech Rift will not be present between realms.\n Eye of the Herald and  Teleport are disabled while in the Death Realm.\nUsing  Unsealed Spellbook to swap Teleport for another summoner spell while in the Death Realm will disable the new summoner spell until the user leaves the realm.(bug)[51]\nControllable pets and  clones can still be commanded between realms.\nMordekaiser will be given gold, if applicable, for  pets killed at the end of Realm of Death.\n Illaoi's  Tentacles will not be killed at the end of Realm of Death.(note)\n Annie's  Tibbers,  Heimerdinger's  H-28Q Apex Turret,  Ivern's  Daisy and  Yorick's  Maiden are considered as \"large pets\" for the purposes of this ability and will follow their respective  champions between realms.\nIf Mordekaiser dies inside of Death Realm while his  Darkness Rise is hitting any of these pets, Darkness Rise will keep affecting the pets until they die or Darkness Rise deactivates normally.(bug)[52]\nSwitching realms detaches all  attached champions on either of the two champions entering the realm.\nThe allied health, resource, and ultimate indicators (champion portraits located on the screen) will not update between realms as the players have no  vision of them.\nPings used in the Death Realm will appear in the chat and mini-map, but will not appear in the map.(note)\nAny spawned terrain while in the Death Realm will remain inside until expired. They will not be destroyed.\nExcept for some cases, spells that require a target to be cast (e.g  Akali's  Shuriken Flip,  Twitch's  Contaminate) will not affect enemies in other realms nor will be castable if there's no targets in the same realm as the caster.\n Amumu's  Bandage Toss,  Blitzcrank's  Rocket Grab,  Leona's  Zenith Blade,  Nautilus'  Dredge Line,  Pyke's  Bone Skewer and  Thresh's  Death Sentence will still hit targets if their caster switches realms before they hit.\n Camille's  The Hextech Ultimatum,  Dr. Mundo's  Goes Where He Pleases,  Nunu & Willump's  Biggest Snowball Ever! and  Absolute Zero,  Pyke's  Death from Below,  Ryze's  Realm Warp,  Shen's  Spirit's Refuge,  Taliyah's  Worked Ground and  Zed's  Shadows will follow their caster between realms.\n Braum's  Glacial Fissure[53],  Pantheon's  Grand Starfall*[54],  Singed's  Mega Adhesive[55],  Varus'  Hail of Arrows[56],  Yasuo's  Wind Wall[57],  Ziggs'  Satchel Charge*[58] and  Zilean's  Time Bomb*[59] will follow their caster between realms but will only be visible in the realm they were cast.(bug)\n Ahri's  Orb of Deception will stay in the realm it was cast.\nThe orb will still go back towards  Ahri's position.\n Akshan's  Avengerang will stay in the realm it was cast.\nThe boomerang will only go back towards  Akshan's position if it was already doing so during the realm switch.\n Akshan's  Comeuppance bullets will get destroyed if he switches realms, even if its target is Mordekaiser.\n Anivia's  Glacial Storm will not be dispelled if Anivia switches realms, but it will only be present in the realm it was cast.\n Bel'Veth's  Void Corals will only be present in the realm they spawned in.\nIf  Bel'Veth switches realms while she is consuming a Void Coral, the Void Coral will dissappear and she will not get her True Form nor deal damage to nearby enemies.\n Camille will still be able to use  Hookshot's dash if she switches realms before the spell hits.\n Ekko's  Parallel Convergence will only be visible in the realm it was cast, but he will still be able to trigger the spell's effect from another realm and it will only affect enemies in said realm.(bug)[60]\n Fizz's  Chum the Waters will follow its target between realms.\n Galio's  Winds of War will follow him if the spell was already on the ground before the realm switch, but it will only be visible in the realm it was cast.(bug)[61]\n Gnar's  Boulder Toss boulder will only be visible in the realm it was cast, but he can still pick it up if he goes to its location.(bug)[62]\n Illaoi's  Test of Spirit tether will be destroyed if her target switches realms.\n Test of Spirit's target will not be made into a Vessel.\n Irelia's  Flawless Duet will be recast automatically when switching realms, and will only affect enemies in the realm it was cast.\nIn some rare cases the spell's effect might follow  Irelia between realms, but it will only be visible in the realm it was cast.(bug)[63]\n Ivern's  Rootcaller can still be recast if the target is in a different realm than him.\n Ivern's  Brushmaker brushes might be visible for a few seconds after switching realms.(bug)[23]\nPassing by the position of a brush created by  Brushmaker in another realm will make units transparent for a few seconds, but they will still be visible to the enemy team.(bug)[23]\n Kai'Sa's  Killer Instinct can only be cast towards enemies in the same realm she is at.\n Kalista's  Fate's Call cannot be cast if her  oathsworn is in another realm, but if the spell was cast before entering the Death Realm, it will function as normal and will only affect targets in the oathsworn's realm.\n Karthus'  Requiem will damage enemies in all realms.\n Kayn's  Umbral Trespass will be interrupted and will not deal damage if its target switches realms.\n Kog'Maw's  Void Ooze will follow him between realms.(bug)[24]\nA part of the VFX will be left in the realm it was cast.(bug)[24]\n Lillia's  Lilting Lullaby will only affect enemies in the same realm as her.\n Lissandra's  Glacial Path can still be recast if the spell was initially cast in another realm.\n Lulu's  Pix will follow her between realms.\nHowever, if Pix is on another  champion, it will visually stay in Lulu's realm but will keep affecting enemies in the Death Realm.(bug)[64]\nPix will still be able to return to Lulu as normal, even if her ally's still in the Death Realm.\n Lux's  Final Spark will follow her between realms.\nThe beam's VFX will only be visible in the realm it was cast.(bug)[65]\n Malzahar's  Void Shift is special cased to not resist the slow but instead resist the realm switch after the cast completes.\n Malzahar's  Call of the Void will follow him if used moments before the realm switch. Also, a part of the VFX will be left in the realm it was cast.(bug)[66]\n Mel's  Golden Eclipse will only deal damage to enemies in the same realm she is at the end of the cast.\n Miss Fortune's  Make It Rain will follow her between realms.(bug)[28]\nThe spell's area VFX will not follow.(bug)[28]\n Naafiri's  Hounds' Pursuit dash will still go through if she switches realms during the cast.\n Nasus'  Spirit Fire will stay in the realm it was cast.\nHowever, the spell will keep affecting enemies in another realm if they were already affected by it before switching realms and they have not left the spell's area.(bug)[67]\n Nautilus'  Depth Charge will not follow its target between realms.(note)\n Neeko cannot be targeted by Realm of Death if she is disguised as a non- champion unit.\n Nilah's  Apotheosis will only deal damage to enemies in the realm it was cast.(note)\nIt will still heal/shield targets in  Nilah's realm at the end of the cast.\n Nocturne's  Paranoia only applies  nearsight to enemy champions in the same realm as him.\n Orianna's  Ball will go back to her after switching realms.\n Orianna's  Command: Shockwave will follow her between realms if her  ball is not on the ground.\nHowever, if her  ball is on the ground,  Command: Shockwave will still follow her between realms but its shockwave will be invisible.(bug)[68]\nAdditionally, if  Command: Shockwave is buffered while  her ball is still flying and she switches realms,  Command: Shockwave's will appear on top of  Orianna, but the actual shockwave will occur at the location  her ball was supposed to land.(bug)[69]\n Poppy's  Keeper's Verdict can send Mordekaiser outside of the Death Realm arena if she uses it during Realm of Death's cast.(bug)[70]\n Pyke's  Phantom Undertow will not follow him if he switches realms while the Phantom is coming back.\n Rakan's  Grand Entrance will follow him between realms, but its initial VFX will not.(bug)[71]\n Rek'Sai's  Tunnels will not follow her between realms.\nIf  Rek'Sai is already on a tunnel when switching realms, her  dash will not be interrupted.\n Sion's  Decimating Smash VFX will follow him between realms, but the spell will only affect enemies in the realm it was cast.(bug)[72]\n Soraka's  Wish will heal targets in all realms.\n Swain's  Nevermove can still be recast if the target is in another realm, but nothing will happen.(note)\n Sylas'  Abduct will not hit enemies if he switches realms during the spell's animation.\n Syndra's  Force of Will will cancel on realm switch.\n Syndra's  Unleashed Power will only affect enemies in the realm it was cast, even if its target is Mordekaiser.\n Tahm Kench's  Devour target will get spit on realm switch.\nThe spell will still deal damage.\n Taliyah's  Weaver's Wall will get interrupted on realm switch.\n Taric's  Bastion link will be temporarily disabled while in the Death Realm.
