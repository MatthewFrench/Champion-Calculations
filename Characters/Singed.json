This is done by delaying the actual debuff by 0.1 seconds.\nIf the target is already affected by the debuff, its duration is refreshed to the maximum (2 seconds).\nWhile active after spawning, a cloud checks for valid targets who remain in or re-enter a cloud every 0.25 seconds.\nValid targets already afflicted with the poison will have their debuff's duration refreshed every 0.25 seconds if applicable.\nIf Singed has moved fewer than 90 units since spawning the last poison cloud, it will spawn 35 units in front of him. They also only spawn every 1 second in this case.\nWhen Singed is moving faster than that, the poison clouds spawn more frequently and on top of himself.",
