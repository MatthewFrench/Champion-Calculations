Subsequent windups on the marked target will refresh this modified duration if the previous attack windup did not complete.\nDespite Senna dealing 1 damage to Mist Wraiths, attacking them will calculate the attack's damage (including  critical strike modifiers) and any on-hit effects for the purposes of  life steal and  drain effects.\nRelic Cannon is only applied if the attack deals more than 0 damage.\nHence, it is not applied if the target is  invulnerable or Senna's basic attack's  attack damage is reduced to 0 or below.\nThe bonus damage is also not applied against  structures (regardless of their vulnerability).\nDealing 0 damage is valid for marking and collecting Mist from champions, but dealing no damage at all is not.\nHence, Senna can mark and collect from  invulnerable enemies.\n Dodge prevents marking and collecting a Mist via Senna's basic attacks and  Piercing Darkness.\nPENDING FOR TEST:: Mist interaction with  block and  blind.\n Nunu & Willump spawn a wraith each.\nEnemies will not see newly spawned wraiths while Senna is not visible.\nA wraith can be hit by  Bard's  Cosmic Binding and it will interact with it the same way minions or monsters interact with Cosmic Binding but it will not take damage.\nMist Wraith has a spawn animation, but is targetable immediately.\nMist Wraith grants a small amount of  sight around itself.\n Runaan's Hurricane secondary bolts will ignore Mist Wraiths.\nAttacking a Mist Wraith will not consume Energized.\nExcluding the range increase and the bonus shielding on  Dawning Shadow, one stack of Mist is worth  46.25 ( +8 from Mist Wraith pickup ( 54.25 total)),  35.62125 if the critical chance is converted to life steal.\n 0.75 AD is worth  26.25.\n 0.5% critical strike chance is worth  20.\n 0.175% life steal is worth  9.37125.\nThe bonus on-hit damage applies an additional stack of  Black Cleaver's Carve.\n Critical strike chance gained from  Yun Tal Wildarrows' Practice Makes Lethal, Augments and  Stat bonuses do not interact with the life steal conversion.(bug)\nThe buff will be granted even when hitting units that have zero movement speed (from which Senna cannot gain any movement speed).\nAttacking structures is special-cased to not grant it at all, however.\nPinging Absolution in the HUD will send a chat message to the team that displays its stack count and her total  attack range accumulated.",

This matters for effects that are consumed on-hit (e.g.  Spellblade), which are applied to the target with the lowest Spawn ID.\n\"Spawn ID\" is an unofficial abbreviation to describe the spawn order for all units at the start of a game, below are some examples.\nIf Senna targets an enemy champion but hits at least one more enemy champion simultaneously,  Press the Attack's first stack will be applied to that target. If no champion was targeted, it will default to the champion with the lowest Spawn ID out of the ones struck by the ability. Whether the effect stacks up on a champion or not when multiple enemy champions are stuck also depends on Spawn ID.\nIf Piercing Darkness struck an enemy champion and turret simultaneously, with  Rapid Firecannon fully charged, the passive effect will most likely trigger on the turret since towers are often spawned before champions.\nFor on-attack effects, they are also applied in order of struck units' spawn IDs. However, there are some specific on-attack effects that will apply to both the target of Piercing Darkness and the target with the lowest Spawn ID if the two unit is not identical.(note) Confirmed cases:\nEnergized effects are stacked twice the amount.\nPENDING FOR TEST:\n Spell shield will not prevent on-hit effects from being applied.\nPENDING FOR TEST: Piercing Darkness interaction with  dodging,  blocking, and  blinding effects.",

      "description_source": "Senna can move while casting Curse of the Black Mist.\nAllies affected by the Curse of the Blast Mist aura receive a buff called Cloak of Mist.\nObscured units appear as Wraiths, hence the name. The wraith model does not distinguish which champion is obscured.\nOn the mini-map, obscured champions will be displayed as wraith icons instead of champion icons to the enemy team.\nIn-game, the 'Cloak of Mist' buff grants camouflage and the 'Wraith Form' buff obscures the unit and grants movement speed. However, 'Cloak of Mist' has the unspecified effect of negating the obscuring effects of 'Wraith Form' (i.e. the unit is not a wraith while inside the mist); the unit has the bonus movement speed even when they are not a wraith (e.g. inside the mist or an enemy is nearby); and 'Wraith Form' also grants the functionality of camouflage (i.e. the unit is treated as a camouflaged unit with regards to  True Sight,  Control Wards, and enemy  champions).\nGiven this overly complex interaction between the two buffs granted as well as the overlapping effects, it is easier to describe the effects as a single buff that is modified in specific circumstances rather than trying to establish a new game mechanic.\nSenna likewise has her aura buff and the 'Wraith Form' buff, but her 'Wraith Form' does not share gameplay functionality with other allies benefiting from Wraith Form. For Senna, the appearance of being a wraith is a form-swap while camouflaged (similar to  Evelynn's  Demon Shade). Senna will remain in her wraith form when she is detected so long as the camouflage effect isn't broken, and her wraith's appearance is very distinct from other wraiths.\nAllied champions who enter the mist and have  stealth of their own will still gain the Wraith Form buff but they will not grant  obscured vision of themselves to the enemy while out of the mist nor will they appear as a Wraith.\nAllies who have their own  camouflage and also have Wraith Form will be revealed to enemies from their stealth's detection range, not Wraith Form's.\nIf Senna gains  invisibility while  camouflaged by Curse of the Black Mist, the visual effects of her aura will be hidden while she is invisible.\nCurse of the Black Mist will not activate if Senna enters  resurrection during the cast time.\nWraith Form will not be granted to allies that are in a  zombie state or are  channeling. It will be granted to allies even if they are  untargetable.\nUsing a basic attack breaks the stealth at the start of the attack windup.\nThe stealth regain timer is refreshed from basic attacks at the start of their attack windup.",
