Other effects (i.e  Teleport) will still cause the buff to linger upon leaving  brush.\nRengar can freely use any  abilities, summoner spells, or item actives while leaping.\nUsing a  dash or  blink ability will interrupt the leap.\nThe attack from the leap will:\nNot go off if the dash was interrupted.\nGo off at the end of the dash even if its normal destination is obstructed by boundaries he cannot cross (e.g. terrain,  The Hextech Ultimatum).\nGo off regardless of distance the enemy travels away from Rengar's original location.\nGo off even if Rengar loses  sight of the target.\nGo off but have no effect if the target dies or becomes  untargetable.\nWhen the attack goes off,  Savagery's empowered attack is consumed.\nThe attack deals  basic damage but is considered  ability damage for  Spear of Shojin.\n Rapid Firecannon's and  Savagery's bonus ranges are lost after 0.25 seconds upon gaining Unseen Predator, and are re-gained after 0.25 seconds upon losing Unseen Predator.\nRengar has a secondary resource bar that indicates how much Ferocity he currently has as pips.\nFerocity generated by Unseen Predator has a purple color.\nFerocity generated by his other abilities has a white color.\nBonetooth Necklace uses different icons corresponding to the number of stacks acquired:\n1 Stack: \n2 Stacks: \n3 Stacks: \n4 Stacks: \n5 Stacks: \n6th Stack:  Head of Kha'Zix",
