This varies by missile, which results in their combined area of effect distributing over a total radius of [explosion radius + maximum spread] = 220 + 60 = 280 units.\nThis means that the distribution area is not random.\nThe order of bolts however, which will determine the order of individual areas to be affected per explosion, is random.\nMel launching the missiles in the same arcing motion for every Radiant Volley cast does not correlate with which missile is being fired at the time. The height and gravity of each missile are irrelevant.\nNote that the combined area of effect may not always be the maximum possible (circle with radius of 280 units); this drawback diminishes with a higher number of bolts as the new missiles fill the gaps within.\nThis ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.",

The replicated missile acquires the original missile source as the target.\nIf the original missile was fired by a  unit or  auto-targeted effect, the replicated missile will be fired as a homing missile with the target being the original missile source.\nHealing projectiles, such as  Soraka's  Rejuvenation and  Sona's  Aria of Perseverance, will instead target Mel.\nIf the original missile was fired via any other targeting paradigm, the replicated missile will by default fire in the direction of the original missile source at the time of replication. This includes  vector-targeted projectiles (currently only  Viktor's  Hextech Ray), for which the origin will always be Mel's center (since she cannot control the cast point).\nThe replicated missile will mimic all of the functions of and copy the behavior of the original missile, unless otherwise stated. This includes every aspect and effect of the missile conforming to the attack or spell from which the missile originated.\nThe scaling of the effects of the copied missile is calculated using the original missile source's attributes (namely their stats). The damage of the missile only benefits from Mel's damage modifiers and magic penetration, and not the original source's.\nThe following missiles are destroyed, but not replicated:\n Draven's  Whirling Death on its way back to him.\n Gnar's  Boomerang Throw on its way back to him.\n Illaoi's  Test of Spirit\n Sivir's  Boomerang Blade on its way back to her.\n Sylas'  Hijack\n Urgot's  Mercy\n Xayah's  Bladecaller and  Featherstorm\n Zac's  Stretching Strikes\nMissiles fired from auto-targeted abilities that target each unit in an area that isn't Mel\nExamples include  Brand's  Conflagration,  Katarina's  Death Lotus,  Samira's  Inferno Trigger, and  Ryze's  Spell Flux.\nThe following abilities will be stopped short of their trajectory without replication:\n Azir's  Emperor's Divide\n Syndra's  Spheres thrown with her  Scatter the Weak\nMel may occasionally fail to attribute  Echoes of Helia's Soul Siphon's damage projectile to herself.(bug)\nThis can cause the enemy to be able to kill their own allies, and gain all the kill's rewards.\nRebuttal will play distinct sound cues from destroying and replicating projectiles fired from specific types of abilities:\nNon-ultimate ability missile: \nUltimate ability missile: \nAbility with global or near-global range missile:",
