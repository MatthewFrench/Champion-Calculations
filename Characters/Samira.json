      "description_source": "The Style stack count is represented by the grades       to the left of Samira's health bar, visible to the player only, as well as a stack counter under the health bar, visible to all players.\nAbilities blocked by  spell shields will still grant Samira Style stacks.\nStyle stacks can be generated via  clones.\nGun and blade attacks do not count as different for the purposes of stacking Style.\nBasic attacks using the blade are still classified as  ranged.\nThe blade attack's range condition is unaffected by  attack range modifiers (e.g.  Rapid Firecannon).\nIts attack range is calculated edge-to-edge, as normal (i.e.,  size modifiers on Samira or her target can still increase the effective distance as basic attack range is added onto unit size).\nThe blade attack bonus deals  default damage.\nThe blade attack bonus does not apply against  structures.\nThe blade attack bonus applies after the primary damage of the attack and is not an  on-hit effect.\nThe empowered attack's bolts deal:\n Basic damage for the first bolt, as a basic attack would.\n Default damage for all subsequent bolts.\nEach bolt from the empowered attack rolls for a  critical strike separately.\nThe empowered attack will trigger on  immobilizes from any source.\nIt specifically cannot trigger against enemies affected by  Blast Cone's displacement triggered by anyone.(note)\nThe empowered attack will not trigger against  crowd control immune and  displacement immune targets.\n Fiora's  Riposte can resist the knock up from Daredevil Impulse, but the ability will not trigger its on- immobilization empowerment condition from the attack alone.(note)\nSamira may dash and have her dash to an  immobilized target canceled an indefinite number of times, so long as the empowered attack has not triggered. When the empowered attack begins, Daredevil Impulse's cooldown is applied on the target which also prevents her from initiating the dash and the attack again on them for the duration.\nThe on-target cooldown will start even if the empowered attack is parried.\nWhile  grounded or  rooted, Samira cannot  dash into range to use the empowered attack. She can only use it if her target is within her  attack range while under this condition.\nThe empowered attack will not apply the knock up against  suspended enemies.\nThe empowered attack will only apply the knock up if the target is still  immobilized or  airborne upon being hit. It will not apply if they are no longer disabled when hit.\nThe empowered attack cannot be used against a target with a  spell shield.\nThe application of the  knock up effect can occur on any of the bolts of the empowered attack if it had not already occurred on the first.\nA missile that is parried by  Riposte or is  dodged,  blocked, or misses while Samira is  blinded cannot apply the knock up in any way.\nThe empowered attack's speed is unaffected by  attack speed modifiers.\nIf Samira is outside maximum initiation range for the dash when targeting an immobilized target, the player must input a new Attack order on the target upon entering initiation range in order to actually initiate the dash.\nHowever if Samira enters the bolts' cast range via her movement while the target is still immobilized without issuing any other commands, the empowered attack will cast without requiring a new order (without the dash).\nThe empowered attack removes any forced movement affecting the target once its knock up ends.(note)\nPENDING FOR TEST: Does this also happen if it's  cleansed.",
