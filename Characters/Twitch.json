Even the primary target can dodge the attack if they are moving quickly enough.\nThe bolt projectiles will naturally pass through terrain and enemy structures (the latter will be damaged by bolts even if they are not directly targeted).\nIf Twitch is  blinded before winding up the attack, the hits will miss against all targets.\n Runaan's Hurricane's Wind's Fury interacts with Spray and Pray's  bonus attack range but not with the modified missile effect (the secondary bolts will not have pass-through effects).\nWhenever the bolts penetrate a target, a small elongated cloud appears at the location, which's VFX and SFX can be seen and heard inside the Fog of War.\nThe bolts' travel distance scales with the full value of Twitch's  attack range increases such as  Rapid Firecannon, but not with size increases (which only increase his effective attack range, thereby the target range).\n(Outdated as of V10.13, now can hit everything with edge range, except for turrets) The  center of a unit must be within the maximum travel distance of the bolt missile, and in front of the spawn location (Twitch's  center) for the bolt to be able to hit them.\nOther than this condition, the bolt missile has to only touch (pass within its half width of 60 units) the  edge of the unit's radius.\nThis is standard behaviour for linear skillshots.\n Malignance's Hatefog is special cased to work with Spray and Pray.\nBolt damage is considered  area of effect for  Axiom Arcanist.\nIt is not considered area of effect for other effects, i.e  omnivamp.",
