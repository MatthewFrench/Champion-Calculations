However, if she has a sufficient amount of armor against a champion dealing both alternates of physical damage and magic damage, she will receive a magic shield as the physical damage threat is already being mitigated by her armor, and vice versa.\nThe type of shield that will be granted to Camille when she attacks any one enemy champion is shown as an icon beneath their health bar: orange for physical shield and blue for magic shield.\nAdaptive Defenses takes priority over all other  shields except  Black Shield.\nAdaptive Defenses Will not grant Camille the shield if the attack is  dodged,  blocked, or if she is  blinded\nThe effect will also not go on cooldown.",
