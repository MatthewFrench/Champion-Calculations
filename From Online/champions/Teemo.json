If Teemo is in a  brush, however, the stealth is not broken by the above effects so long as his destination location is still inside brush.\nDue to the unique implementation of Guerilla Warfare's stealth:\nSome area-of-effect (AoE)  knockups, may not be able to break Teemo's stealth.(bug)\nWhile Teemo is  airborne without his stealth broken, other area-of-effect spells (mostly older ones) are able to break Teemo's stealth, such as  Randuin's Omen's Humility.(bug)\nA highly technical explanation can be found here.\nUsing a basic attack breaks the stealth at the end of the attack windup.",
