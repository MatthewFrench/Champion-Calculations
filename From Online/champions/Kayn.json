Melee champions drop red orbs that grant progress towards  Darkin Slayer, while  ranged champions drop blue orbs that grant progress for  Shadow Assassin. Orbs will remain on the ground until automatically collected by Kayn regardless of range once he leaves combat. The orbs will be collected even if Kayn  dies.\nThe experience bar above his portrait gauges his current progression, the color reflects the form with greater progress. Kayn can transform by interacting with his portrait, and can wait 4 minutes until the other form becomes available, reduced by 5 seconds for each collected orb of their type after that.\n\nMelee orbs grant 2 points per hit and 6 points per takedown.\nRanged orbs grant 3 points per hit and 7 points per takedown.\nThe amount of points received per orb is multiplied by 3 : 10.39 (based on minutes).\nThe bar gets filled up completely at 500 points.\nIf the two forms are within 8% of each other, the last champion range type hit will determine the winner. If both types are hit at the same time, the transformation will default to  Darkin Slayer.\nEach side's bar has a bucket system, starting at 60 points.\nEach time an orb is taken the system checks if there's an amount of points in the bucket equal to or higher than the amount received from the orb.If there is, Kayn is given an additional orb of the same type he received, while also subtracting that amount of points from the bucket.\nThe bucket fills by 0.8 points per second if out of champion combat for 70 seconds.\nDamage dealt by  damage over time effects and specifically  First Strike and  Summon Aery will not grant orbs.\nThe following table refers for interactions while Kayn is transforming:\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nDisabled\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll items are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nDisabled\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll summoner spells are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A",
