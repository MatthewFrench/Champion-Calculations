This causes his secondary resource bar to render incorrectly.(bug)\nThe current cooldowns of Viego's abilities will not be reset between transformations.\nThose of the possessed champion's abilities will be reset between transformations.\nThis does not apply to the following long-cooldown abilities. Viego specifically tracks their proper cooldowns which can be seen via a buff in his hotbar for each when applicable.\n Anivia's  Rebirth\n Azir's  Shurima's Legacy\n Zac's  Cell Division\nViego will not track  Zaahen's  Cultivation of War's cooldown.(bug)\nThe passive cooldowns of items are shared between Viego's and the possessed champion's.\nThis does not apply to Lifeline items.(note)\nOnce possession ends, Viego returns to his normal state and certain effects gained from the possessed champion's abilities will be immediately removed.\nSome buffs will be kept and some buffs will be lost.\nViego will almost always keep  shields and  spell shields.\nPassive effects will be lost by default, as Viego no longer has their abilities.\n Channeled and charged abilities maintained will be interrupted, and without granting any cancelation refunds to the respective slot (if applicable).\nToggled abilities will be automatically toggled off.\nWhen taking possession of  Kled, Viego's current health percentage will become Kled's health percentage, while  Skaarl's health will be low.\nIf Viego's current health is under health, he will dismount twice(bug) upon taking possession of Kled and receive  Frayed Nerves.\nOnce possession ends, Viego only keeps  Kled's health percentage as his current.\nPENDING FOR TEST: What determines Skaarl's health if Viego is at health?\nViego retains his own summoner spells, trinket item, and runes during possession.\nMist Wraiths will still spawn while Viego is in a zombie state.\nSovereign's Domination will not summon a Mist Wraith from  clones.\nThe possession will not expire while Viego is in a  zombie state.\nWhile in a zombie state,  Heartbreaker is disabled.\nIf Viego enters a zombie state while winding up on a Mist Wraith, the possession will still last its normal duration.(note)\nThe possession will not end prematurely if Viego enters  resurrection.\nThe possession will end if it expires while Viego is under  Zaahen's  Cultivation of War's  resurrection; he will lose all its effects instantly and be revived without restoring the complete amount of health.(bug)\nThe possession will acquire the basic abilities of shapeshifting champions (e.g.  Elise's  Spider Form / Human Form,  Jayce's  Transform Mercury Cannon /  Transform Mercury Hammer, and  Nidalee's  Aspect of the Cougar) based on which form they died as.\nMist Wraiths are considered  clones and can only be targeted by Viego.\nIf Viego possesses an enemy champion who owns  Dark Seal or  Mejai's Soulstealer, he will gain their Glory stacks during the possession.\nAs  Cull tracks its progress for each player even if they do not possess the item at the time, Viego may discharge stacks for the benefit of  1 each per  minion kill, and if Viego killed 100 minions possessing  Cull, no matter whether bought himself or acquired via a possessed champion's inventory, he receives the  350 payout and can no longer discharge stacks.\nThis entire interaction does not interact with the state of the  Cull stacks of the enemy.\nThe stacks shown on the item in the inventory and scoreboard may not update properly, however.\nIf Viego possesses an enemy champion who owns  Tear of the Goddess, the stacks it has will be transferred to his  Tear of the Goddess if he owns one.\nIf Viego possesses an enemy  Bel'Veth, his attack speed cap will be modified to 90 permanently.(bug)\nIf Viego posesses an enemy  Evelynn, he will never activate the healing from  Demon Shade.(bug)\nIf Viego possesses an enemy  K/DA Evelynn, he will still hear  Demon Shade's music upon discarding the possession if he does it while active.(bug)\nIf Viego targets a Mist Wraith while already  untargetable he will become targetable once again during the cast time.(bug)\nIf Viego possesses an enemy on  Howling Abyss, he will be able to use the shop upon returning to the fountain and discarding the possession.(bug)\nIf Viego posesses an enemy  Naafiri, he will keep her  Packmates upon discarding the possession.(bug)\nThe following table refers for interactions while Viego is winding up on a Mist Wraith:\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nDisabled\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll items are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nDisabled\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Flash  Teleport  Recall  Hexflash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath",
