The snapshot lasts until the debuff expires.\nThe target's resistances will be further reduced by 5% per drain tick, up to 20% by the end of the drain (totaling to 40% reduction from the initial 20% reduction on-cast).\nTrundle will gain the reduced resistances of the target for himself for as long as they remain reduced, including while they are lingering after the drain.\nThe resistances gained is based on the current reduced resistances of the target; the total amount that would be reduced is not granted to Trundle all at once. In other words, he will initially gain 20% of the target's resistances, then the remaining 20% over the 4 seconds, gaining additional bonus resistances equal to the resistances reduced per drain tick.\nTrundle gains 11.7 extra  range on his  basic attacks (relative to his and enemy center) as a consequence of his increased  size.\nSo do his enemies.\nHe gains 3.78 to 6.255 range against the target he subjugated, depending on their base size, and so does the target against him.\nThe debuff on the target also persists through death.\nTrundle will lose the buff if the target loses the debuff, for example if it enters  resurrection.(note)\nIf the target becomes  untargetable,  dies, or is too far away or no longer in  sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on  cooldown nor pay its cost (if applicable).",
