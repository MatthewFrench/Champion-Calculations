Any commands it was issued to follow a target will not be interrupted.\nThe storm will follow its target even if they are not  visible, but only for up to 1 second.\nIf it does not gain vision of its target within that time, it changes its target.\nThe storm is obstructed by terrain. If it encounters terrain, then it will automatically navigate its path towards the target.\nThe empowered attacks will not trigger nor be consumed if they hit a structure or ward or are parried.",
