If Sleepy Trouble Bubble is cast right before she blinks back to Portal Jump's original cast position, the range of the missile will be extended for it to fire to the same end position as if she had not blinked back. This interaction occurs in this manner due to the missile's behavior as explained prior and the fact that Zoe blinks back with Portal Jump before the cast time of Sleepy Trouble Bubble finishes, causing the cast time to finish from Portal Jump's original cast position.\nThis will still count as damage dealt by Zoe in the damage recap.\n\n\nType\n\nCast time\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nDisabled\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll items are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nDisabled\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Flash  Teleport  Recall  Hexflash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath, unless protected by  Resurrection",
