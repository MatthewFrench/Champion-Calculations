This defines a forward distance for basic attacks and a backwards distance for  Pierce. Empirical testing has given the following values below.\nBasic attack dash range given the angle θ:\n{(175+(125×sin⁡(θ)))×T\nWhere T=0.800,0.875,0.950,1.000 depending on the tier of Boots (T0, T1, T2, T3)\nMinimum dash range of 225 units when dashing backwards\n Pierce's dash range given the angle θ:\n{150+(150×sin⁡(θ))Backwards300Otherwise\nThere is a very brief grace period after completing a basic attack windup wherein  Kalista can still input a movement command to trigger the dash.\nThe dash speed is unaffected by additive movement speed modifiers.\nThere are a total of 24 different dash ranges based on direction with Boots and  Pierce being cast.\nKalista will automatically be issued an attack command on her attack target at the end of the dash, as long as they remain in her attack range by then.\nThe attack move (default A + MB1) click feature checks for targets in brief intervals only if Kalista is not dashing.\n Sleep does not count for knocking the dash down.(bug)",
