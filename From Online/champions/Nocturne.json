It is a form of  obscured vision; the trail indirectly reveals the location of enemy units even in the fog of war, including those shrouded by  stealth.\n Spell shield will block the damage and also prevents the Dusk Trail from following the target.\nThe formed Dusk Trail does not disappear if Duskbringer is intercepted by  Wind Wall or  Unbreakable.\nThis ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the start of the cast time.\nThe bonus movement speed  stacks multiplicatively with other sources of movement speed boosts.",
