While both stack  on-hit, the bonus damage stacks are consumed  on-attack, and the healing ones  on-hit.\nThe healing stacks are denoted in the buff-bar.\nIf  Guinsoo's Rageblade were to trigger when the stacks are at maximum, they will grant the healing but not the bonus damage, thus causing an out-of-sync between the stacks shown in-game versus when the bonus damage is dealt.\nOnly the initial slash of  Wind Becomes Lightning can generate a Determination stack. Slashes after the first do not count for stack generation.\nThe stack counter displays 1:3 rather than the usual 0:2, meaning that a count of 1 does not translate to having 1 stack.\nStacks reset when Xin Zhao  dies.\nStacks of Determination will be gained even if the attack is  blocked.\nPENDING FOR TEST:: Determination's interaction with parrying effects ( dodge,  blind).\nDetermination deals  proc damage.\nSince it is a separate instance of damage when applied by basic attack or either of  Wind Becomes Lightning's strikes, flat damage reduction that applies to both the main and bonus damage such as  Amumu's  Tantrum's passive will reduce each, for twice the reduction.\nThe bonus damage cannot  critically strike.\nWhen applied by a basic attack:\nThe attack uses a unique animation.\nThe bonus damage benefits from  life steal.\nPENDING FOR TEST: It applies life steal specifically.\nNeither the bonus damage or heal will be blocked by  spell shield.\nWhen applied by  Wind Becomes Lightning:\nTriggers against the closest target struck by the first slash/thrust (equals first target to receive spell effects).\nDoes not benefit from  life steal, including not healing from Wind Becomes Lightning's 33% conversion for this bonus damage.\nSince  proc damage is 'single target',  Vamp will heal from 100% of the bonus damage.\nThe bonus damage will be blocked by  spell shield, the heal will not.\nChallenged Details\n Spell shield will block the mark application from  Wind Becomes Lightning, but not from basic attacks and  Audacious Charge.",

Is the tip of the ability enough to reveal him? Whether it can hit a minion or not? Just if he's around the exit of the fog of war, and even if he points towards the inside of the fog of war? [2]\n Spell shield will block both the slashes and the thrust.\nIf the spell shield blocks the first, or sometimes the second slash, it will block the rest of the ability, including the thrust. If it is activated after the first slash, it will only block up to 2 slashes and will not block the trust.(bug)\nThis ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.\nThe thrust will occur from wherever Xin Zhao is at the end of the cast time.\nThe slashes will occur from wherever Xin Zhao is at the time during the first 0.15 seconds.\nWind Becomes Lightning's end point will not move in relation to Xin Zhao if he moves during the cast time.\nThe direction of the slashes will also not move during the cast time.\nThe first strike's hitbox includes a  275 radius 160° cone in front of Xin Zhao and an additional  125 radius around him.\nThe second strike's hitbox includes the same  125 radius around Xin Zhao, a missile with  1000 range and  80 total width, and a  -60 radius area check upon the end of the missile.\nThe 125 radius check does not hit champion summoned units.(note)\nBecause Wind Becomes Lightning uses an older type of 'healing based on life steal' and not applies life steal,  Spirit Visage will amplify the life gain twice (+25% life steal and +25% healing), for a total of +56.25%.\nEach of Wind Becomes Lightning's slashes are applied in a separate damage instance from each other.\nThis causes effects like  Bone Plating to be applied twice and  Black Cleaver's Carve to be applied multiple times.",
