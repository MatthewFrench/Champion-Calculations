        "notes": "All Out's cast has a  forgiveness radius of  50 units.\nIf the terrain behind the target is invalid by not having an opposite side, All Out will not trigger its additional effects from pulling the target over terrain.\nThe pull destination in this case would be inside terrain and thus the displacement would stop at the boundary.\nK'Sante will restore the exact amount of mana he had before going All Out after the buff expires.\nThe amount does not change even if his maximum mana changes during the effect.\nWhile the target is being  pulled over terrain, they are additionally  attached to a missile that travels in the same trajectory as the displacement, becoming detached afterwards.\nRemoving the  airborne debuff will not cause the target to detach from the missile.\nIf the target resists the  pull by having a  spell shield or being  immune to crowd control or  displacement immune, K'Sante will still blink beyond the pull's end location as if the target were displaced.\nK'Sante's strike at the end of the displacement when the target is pulled over terrain does not apply  Dauntless Instinct's mark.\nGoing All Out does not override K'Sante's attack or movement commands if the target does not collide with terrain.\nIf the target is however pulled through terrain then K'Sante will be ordered to  basic attack the target afterwards.\nThe percentage bonus armor penetration  stacks additively with other sources of percentage armor penetration.(note)\nSince K'Sante retains the stats he \"lost\", any effects that scale based on those stats will calculate based on the value prior to him going All Out.\nHis base resistances can be reduced below 0 by his bonus resistances.\nAll Out will not take into account resistances gained through % bonuses (eg.  Conditioning,  Mountainous Vigor, etc) when reducing K'Sante's base resistances.(bug)\n Jak'Sho, The Protean's Voidborn Resilience specifically is taken into account.\nGaining bonus health during All Out causes the health threshold to be briefly increased then reset back to its original value.\nThe bonus health is still applied to his current health.\nDuring All Out's cast and displacement, the target's camera is locked and centered on their champion.\nFor K'Sante, his camera centers on him at the start of the cast time, then once again at the end of the cast time at the location of his blink behind the target, and it is not locked.\nAll Out's granted  untargetability from the  vanish during the target's pull does not  destroy in-flight  projectiles.\nIf the target becomes  untargetable,  dies, or is too far away or no longer in  sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on  cooldown nor pay its cost (if applicable).\nThe following table refers for interactions while K'Sante is in cast time:\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nDisabled\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\n Shurelya's Battlesong  Youmuu's Ghostblade  Randuin's Omen\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll the other item-actives are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nUsable\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Flash  Teleport  Recall  Hexflash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath, unless protected by  Resurrection\n\nThe following table refers for interactions while K'Sante is performing All Out's cast:\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nDisabled\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll items are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nDisabled\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Flash  Teleport  Recall  Hexflash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath",
