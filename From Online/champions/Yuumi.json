There's a small grace period in which she can recast You and Me! to attach to another champion without the  channel or dash in the target direction.\nYuumi can dash to targetable  zombie state allies (currently only  Sion's  Glory in Death), but she cannot attach when she reaches them.\nThe same goes for allies channeling  Teleport.\nWhile attached to the Anchor, Yuumi is considered in being at her Anchor's position, regardless of where she is visually placed near them. For example,  turret shots will appear as if they were hitting the Anchor, but in reality they're actually hitting Yuumi.\nHowever, for the purposes of You and Me!, such as casting it or being unattached for other reasons, Yuumi will be in the position where she visually is. For example, when she is in the blue team, dashing to a north-east ally is considerably slower than dashing to a south-west ally.\nHer  monster aggression transfers to the Anchor.\nEnemies are credited an assist on Yuumi if they damaged the Anchor at any point and she dies within the standard credit timer.\nYuumi will always be  visible if her Anchor can be seen, and she will always not be visible if her Anchor cannot be seen. These rules apply regardless of  reveal effects and  stealth.\nYuumi will not  vanish if her Anchor does.\nIf Yuumi is on the blue team, she will remain attached on the southwest side; if Yuumi is on the red team, she will remain on the northeast. While channeling  Final Chapter, she will be behind her Anchor.\nThe player's screen will briefly flash red if Yuumi is affected by a  immobilizing or  grounding effect, or if she forcibly detaches from her Anchor.\n Sleep does not count for knocking the dash down.(bug)\nThe Anchor's health bar will have a different frame to indicate the attached status:\n\nThe following table refers for interactions while Yuumi is  channeling:\n\n\nType\n\nChannel\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nDisabled\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\n Shurelya's Battlesong  Youmuu's Ghostblade  Randuin's Omen\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll the other item-actives are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nUsable\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Teleport  Recall  Hexflash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\n Flash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath Grounding effects Immobilizing effects Cast-inhibiting effects\n\nThe following table refers for interactions while Yuumi is  attached:\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nAllowed\n\n\nMovement\n\nDisabled\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\nAll the other item-actives are usable\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Hextech Rocketbelt\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nUsable\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Flash  Teleport  Recall  Hexflash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath\n\nBuffering Interactions\nAll of Yuumi's abilities can be buffered while channeling and dashing.\n Summon Aery would not trigger from the heal or shield when buffered.(bug)",
