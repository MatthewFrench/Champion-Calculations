# Vladimir URF Build Goal

Goal: In URF, maximize how long Vladimir survives and how much damage he deals to enemies around him while surviving. I mainly use his pool ability (Sanguine Pool), and while in pool, no one can damage him. The build and strategy should prioritize durability, sustained damage, and pool uptime; other abilities are secondary.
