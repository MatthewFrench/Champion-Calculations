# Commercial Licensing Status

This project is currently offered publicly only under `AGPL-3.0-or-later`.

As of February 16, 2026, there is no separate commercial license being offered.

The maintainer may choose to offer separate commercial/proprietary licenses in the future for code where the maintainer controls licensing rights (including rights obtained through `CLA.md`).

This file is a policy notice, not a current offer to contract.
